  <h3>My Bio: What is my background?</h3>
  <p>I was born by the name Ikenna Asad Ugwuh, November 29, 1991 in Long Island, New York. I currently reside in Atlanta, Georgia, where I work as a freelance front end developer with 7+ years of design experience and 3+ years of professional developing experience. I‚Äôve been designing graphics since I got Microsoft Paint on my first computer at 9 years old. This is my personal website.</p>
  <p>Yeah, it‚Äôs fun to make stuff, but I also like making stuff better. I love getting the opportunity to work with both clients and civic hackers especially to realise their dream of establishing digital properties which suit their individual needs. Currently, I‚Äôm working on becoming more actively involved in the web design community. I‚Äôve made a handful of websites and print and logo designs for small businesses, but I have major designs to expand my portfolio with the work I could do for many other businesses or corporations, community activists, nonprofits, churches, actors, comedians, musicians and more.</p>
  <button>(+) even more about me...</button>
  <p>Using my eye for exquisite detail, swift appreciation for design, and years of programming experience, I ensure that the digital work I deliver is always of exceptional quality, always fully responsive and always speedy, semantically valid (for vanilla layouts) and SEO friendly. Using feature detection, I can make certain that my designs and digital innovations are fully functional and compatible across virtually all major devices and browsers. Having a fully responsive website provides a user experience that is best and most appropriately suited to the device he or she happens to be using. This means that every site I develop is delivered with a layout that can best make use of the space and features available on practically any size of device.</p>
  <p>I have over a decade‚Äôs worth of experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, and converting the designs I create into semantically valid, high-performance code. But not only have I obtained the knowhow to design and develop an impressive and compelling front end, but I have also picked up on various ways of integrating the front end with well developed server-side code. It is this knowledge I have of programming in multiple departments and on multiple turfs that allows me to work on a project in open acreage with its full scope in mind, making it easier to elucidate and document the various aspects of the development process, which facilitates cohesive collaboration with little to no confusion.</p>
